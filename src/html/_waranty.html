						<p>ZEN cards have a very neat feature that will help you whenever your electronic devices start failing after the standard warranty ends, which is pretty common.</p>
						<br>
						<p>When you buy any electronics with your ZEN shopping MastercardÂ®, their warranty gets extended by one year. How does it work? It simply does. Automatically.</p>
